description: Widely considered one of Galsworthy's best novels, Fraternity is filled
  with memorable and sympathetic characters, including the beautiful model Ivy Barton,
  the painter Bianca Dallison, the utopian dreamer Mr. Stone, and the working-class
  Hughes family. One contemporary critic called Fraternity as near being a perfect
  work of art as any novel ever written."
